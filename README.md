Weather Update, Synopsis Group Project 2021-22 

## Introduction
Weather is defined as the state of the atmosphere concerning winds, temperature, cloudiness, moisture, pressure etc. It describes to which degree it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather is different in different parts of the world and changes over minutes, hours, days and weeks. On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere.
Weather forecasting is the prediction of weather conditions for a given location and time, using science and technology. Weather forecasting is very useful because it helps to protect life and property, and prepare people for upcoming events. 

Air pollution due to solid particles and gases can be harmful to anyone, children and senior citizens alike. It can cause a range of diseases like high blood pressure, lung cancer, stroke, respiratory infections etc. Air quality index or AQI is a system used to warn the public about poor air quality, to reduce the risk of being harmed. 
Thus, live weather updates, weather forecasting, and air quality index play a vital role in our day-to-day lives.

## Objective
Making a system that displays live updates for weather information to the user. 

## Input
The system will automatically get the geolocation of the end user. However, the user can also type in the name of the desired location.

## Output
Weather forecast of the input location, complete with 
- Current Weather and Temperature
- Air quality index
- Humidity
- UV-index
- 10-day prediction 

## Functions & Features
- Simple to use graphical interface, without any complex GUI package
- Weather prediction throughout the globe using OpenWeather API
- Users need not input their current location. Once the system is re-opened, it will refer to the last location saved
- Information on “What happened on this day”, accompanied by a link to that Wikipedia article

## Hardware
An i3 laptop, 2 or 4 GB RAM with Windows 10

## Software
Python 3.9, Windows Powershell, Microsoft Visual Studio Code

## Scope & Limitations:
- An API is required for which a fixed scale is necessary
- Withdrawal of data is limited
- Accessing an API is not always easy
