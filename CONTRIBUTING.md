# CONTRIBUTING GUIDE

Use Powershell/Command Line for the following commands

*Note:* here terminal and command line mean the same thing, and are used interchangeably.

## Fork the project repository
Find the project's repository on GitHub, and then "fork" it by clicking the Fork button in the upper right corner.
This creates a copy of the project repository in your GitHub account. In the upper left corner, you will see that you are now looking at a repository in your account.

## Clone this repository on your local machine
First change the current directory to your choice, example *Desktop*

```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/weather-update.git
```

This command will open vscode

```
code weather-update
```

## Create a virtual environment and launch it
To first create a virtual environment, run this command in your terminal. Don't run this segment in Powershell, but on Command Line (cmd)
```
create_venv.bat
```
Once the virtual environment is created, run this command to launch it
```
launch_venv.bat
```
## Uploading the work to GitHub
